A plugin for ImageJ to browse the content of an Orthanc server, then import 2D/3D DICOM images from Orthanc into ImageJ.

This plugin hopefully greatly simplifies the indexation of DICOM images when dealing with ImageJ (e.g. for quality control of DICOM modalities, or for pedagogical use). There is also no need to carry on any complex network configuration, since the plugin directly uses the REST API of Orthanc. This makes its installation and its use quite straightforward.

Pre-compiled binaries are available [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/orthancserver/files/ImageJ).
